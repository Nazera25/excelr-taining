            Albert Einstein - Look deep into nature, and then you will... Look deep into nature, 
            and then you will understand everything better. Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished. 
            It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder.
            We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.This is something I choose to live by. 
            When I step out of the everyday world I find a fulfillment within myself.
            Going into nature and being surrounded by the wisdom of the trees, the beauty of the grasses, the inspiration of the mountains, 
            and the warmth of the sun I can feel the subtle peace enter my body, mind, and spirit. I am now home once again.
            When looking deep into nature, I am looking deep within myself, realizing once again that 
            I am part of this thing called Mother Earth. I am what makes up the divine being of the planet.

            Beyond India’s buzzing cities nature lovers can discover serene sanctuaries teeming with wildlife.
             While the iconic Bengal tiger—India’s national animal—is the top draw for safari-goers,
             an impressive array of wild things can be spotted in India’s teakwood forests, grasslands, mountains, rivers, and other natural spaces.
            India has more than a hundred national parks, covering over 15,600 square miles of protected land. 
            Many of the country’s wildlife sanctuaries once were hunting reserves of the maharajas, and more than 50 have been designated as tiger reserves. According to the last available census, done in 2014 by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), India is home to 2,226 tigers, 70 percent of which reside within tiger reserves.
            If you’re ready to fulfill a bucket-list dream of seeing a wild Bengal tiger or are eager to spot Asian elephants, Asiatic wild dogs, 
            and other species rarely seen outside of zoological parks, here are six superlative spots in India for wildlife watching.

            Nature is filled with so much beauty, life & wisdom that it’s only natural to feel uplifted in the presence of big trees & singing birds.
            But have you ever thought about why we feel this way? I’ve learned from experience that being in touch with a genuine love for nature
            makes it easier to share that love and pass it on to others in our life (like children, friends & family).
            To cultivate appreciation for all aspects of nature is an essential step towards bringing our modern society into harmony with life 
            on this earth.So I thought it would be fun to share a list of my own reasons why I love nature, and I’m excited to discover
            which ones resonate the deepest with you!
